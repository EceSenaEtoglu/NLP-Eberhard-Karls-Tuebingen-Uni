## Project Overview

# Sentiment Classification for Movie Reviews

### Objective
Developed a sentiment classification model for movie reviews using a variant of the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset.

### Data Preprocessing
- Applied general cleaning:
  - Removed HTML tags and URLs.
- Implemented performance-enhancing preprocessing:
  - Case normalization, punctuation and emoji removal, and lemmatization, tailored for binary sentiment classification.

### Models and Techniques
- Evaluated two models: Naive Bayes and RNN, using TF-IDF and Count Vectorization techniques.
- Selected the best-performing vectorization technique for each model based on validation results.

### Report
- Provided reasoning for choosing the Stanford Sentiment Treebank variant due to its reputation in sentiment analysis tasks.
- Detailed the preprocessing steps, vectorization methods, model architectures, and comparative analysis of Naive Bayes and RNN performance.
